## ⋆｡˚•✧˖°OVERVIEW
SpotiPix is a cute desktop widget app that mimics a music player. I've been heavily inspired by the i-pod style designs, just made it more modern :D

## 𖡼.𖤣𖥧𖡼.𖤣𖥧 Why I Made This Project
I honestly love listening to songs and I thought that maybe I should convert one of my playlists into a cute desktop widget app....so yeah! this app has all the songs I've listened to during this summer on repeat. I hope you enjoy the 24 tracks in them!

---

##  How I Built It
- **HTML5** – structure
- **CSS3** – design & animation (custom gradients + Google Fonts)
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – interactivity, timer logic, local storage
- **Tauri** – backend

## .𖥔 ݁ ˖𓂃.☘︎ ݁˖ How to Use
1. Download the 'spotipix_windows.zip' folder from releases.
2. Extract the files from the zip folder.
3. Allowing the app to make changes to your computer
4. Select the destination for the installation
5. then hurray! you've got the app :D 🌸

## ᨒ↟ 𖠰𖥧˚ Challenges and Learnings
Like any first real-world project, I ran into a few bumps along the way:
-deciding between Tauri and Electron.js
-learning the Tauri backend and trying to debug the config file
-getting confused between the versions

But through these challenges, I learned the importance of:
- developing this real desktop widget app
- avoiding breakage of audio files and images by fixing naming inconsistencies of the folders.
- learning how to deploy it properly as a zip file and utilize github releases for it

---

## 🗓️ What's Next?
I plan to keep improving SpotiPix by:
- Adding custom tracks
- connecting spotify accounts to it potentially
